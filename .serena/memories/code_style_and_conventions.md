- SVG paths and masks are used for animation.
- Naming convention: mask ids are 'spray-mask-<segment>', and path ids are 'star-1', 'star-2', ..., 'letter-c', etc.
- Fill color for animated paths is '#111' (HTML) or 'black' (SVG source).
- Each path is masked with the corresponding spray mask.
- HTML and SVG are indented with 2 spaces.
- No JavaScript is used for the animation; all is declarative SVG.
